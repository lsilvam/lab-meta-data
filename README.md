# lab metadata

This repository contains different templates folder with READMES, and also  `json` files that I created to keep my experimenta data  organized.
More information about each one in the respective folder.

## usage

Everytime that is required create a `json` file in the folder of the experiment, and then populate it  with the relevant information.
The idea of using `.json` is that it makes it easier to edit a `.json` file in a simple text editor compared to a table, mostly 
when there are different obervations for the same sample the focus in taking notes in the lab can be in the observation and not 
in repeating the sample name over and over. Lastly, `.json` files can be easily edited in in small vertical windows without breaking its
structure. 

Naming files:
1. pattern "YYYYMMDD_fooo_n0#"
   1. where `food` means anything that makes sense for the file to be names
      1. I used to put the name of the technique, for example, `YYYMMDD_bradford_n01`
         1. if I recorded the experiments in order then it would be something as `YYYYMMDD_westernBlot01_n01`
   2. If I found a conflict in name, which is very rare, I would add `_a,b,c...z` to the filename
      1. this way the files would maintain there order
   3. when applied each replicate is numbered `n01 ... n03`
      1. if all replicates are inside the file rename to something relatable to the experiment, for example `run01` for PCRs or `observation01` for microscopy 

# disclaimer
These are files that I created to help me keeping my information organized, and sharable with future me. Most likely there is a betterr way to do this. Anyway if you find them useful feel free to used/edit them.
